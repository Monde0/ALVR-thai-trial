## Docker as an Infrastructure

Inside the Infrastructure folder, there will contains two different folder, which is database and data visualization based on docker approach, also there will be some technique and artifact to do this data pipeline on cloud as well.

## Docker as a database

Currently, I have create the docker compose file that contain postgresql database and pgadmin4 for database bench tool which is come in handy to perform database stuff. (I also provide mock data as well)

## Docker as a data visualization

Grafana are well known open-source for data visualization which are utilized in this project. I also applied docker compose for grafana which is lightweight and independent.
